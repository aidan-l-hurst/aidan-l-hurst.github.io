Malware Detection & Incident Response: 
-Investigated a suspicious file using its SHA-256 hash and VirusTotal OSINT 
(Open-Source Intelligence); documented findings in an incident handlerâ€™s journal.
SIEM Querying in Splunk: 
-Used SPL to identify IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) such as failed login attempts 
and impossible travel; developed familiarity with search syntax and detection.
Security Alert Triage: 
-Analyzed a mock security alert ticket using a standard playbook; documented IOCs 
and proposed escalation steps; developed investigation and triage skills.
